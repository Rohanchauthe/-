Hospital Database Management System
SQL-Based Data Modeling & Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a Hospital Database Management System using SQL to efficiently store, manage, and analyze healthcare-related data. The database models real-world hospital operations such as patient management, doctor assignments, appointments, treatments, and billing.

The goal of this project is to build a well-structured relational database and extract meaningful insights using SQL queries to support operational and data-driven decision-making in a healthcare environment.

🎯 Project Objectives

Design a normalized hospital database schema

Create tables with appropriate primary and foreign keys

Maintain data integrity using constraints

Insert and manage hospital operational data

Write optimized SQL queries to answer real-world business questions

Analyze hospital operations using structured data

🗂️ Database Description

The hospital database includes multiple interrelated tables representing core hospital entities:

Patients – Patient demographic and medical information

Doctors – Doctor details and specializations

Departments – Hospital departments

Appointments – Patient-doctor appointment records

Treatments – Diagnosis and treatment information

Billing – Payment and billing records

The database follows normalization principles to minimize redundancy and ensure consistency and accuracy.

🔍 SQL Analysis Performed

Retrieval of patient and doctor details using JOINs

Department-wise and doctor-wise appointment analysis

Patient visit frequency analysis

Treatment cost and billing analysis

Identification of high-activity departments

Revenue and operational insights generation

📊 Key Insights

Certain departments handle a significantly higher number of appointments

Patient visit frequency varies across departments and doctors

Treatment and billing data helps identify high-revenue services

Proper database design improves query performance and accuracy

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

SQL

MySQL / PostgreSQL

Relational Database Concepts

ER Diagrams

Data Normalization

Constraints & Indexing

📌 SQL Concepts Applied

CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements

Primary Keys & Foreign Keys

INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN

Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

GROUP BY & HAVING clauses

Subqueries

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of SQL and relational database design in a real-world healthcare scenario. It strengthened my understanding of database modeling, data integrity, and writing efficient SQL queries to solve business and operational problems.
